# book-producer

This repository is the documentation, source, build, test, and publish workspace for the `book-producer` package.

The runtime framework README that gets installed into target repositories is:

- [`.book-framework/README.md`](./assets/README.md)

`book-producer` is a stage-based book creation framework for AI-assisted writing. It gives AI assistants a structured way to handle book projects — from concept to published manuscript — with persistent book-aware context instead of relying only on chat history.

The framework combines detailed staged instructions, reusable templates, and specialist agents that are invoked based on the task at hand. It is designed to work with Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Antigravity, and similar AI coding and writing environments.

## What it does

`book-producer` supports a two-step install model:

1. A user installs the package globally on their machine from npm or from a GitHub Packages mirror.
2. The user runs `book-producer install` inside any repository where they want to write a book.

Inside that target repository:

- `.book-framework/` stores the installed framework package assets
- `.spec/<book-slug>/` stores book workflow memory and stage specs
- `<book-slug>/` at repo root stores chapter drafts and the final manuscript

Once installed and initialized, the framework helps an AI assistant understand:

- the current book idea and its slug
- the current workflow stage
- what has already been decided and written
- what file should be updated next
- how to continue work consistently across supported tools and chat sessions
- the instruction/spec language for book-scoped workflow files
- main and secondary writing languages for multilingual books

## Why it exists

Most AI writing workflows lose context between chats, tools, and sessions. `book-producer` exists to give AI assistants a predictable, durable workflow model inside the repository itself.

Instead of depending only on temporary chat history, the framework stores book progress and stage outputs in markdown files that travel with the repository. This makes it easier to:

- resume writing later without re-explaining context
- switch between supported AI tools
- keep planning and implementation grounded in written state
- reduce repeated prompting
- keep multi-stage book work organized from concept through manuscript assembly

## The package

The package installs a global CLI named:

- `book-producer`

The built package ships:

- compiled CLI output (`dist/`)
- framework assets (`assets/`)
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `VERSIONS.md`
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`
- `UPGRADING.md`
- `LICENSE`

## How to install it

Install the public npm package with:

```bash
npm install -g book-producer
```

Then, inside a target repository:

```bash
book-producer install
```

For resetting the framework back to the defaults and overwriting everything under `.book-framework/`:

```bash
book-producer install --force
```

## What files it creates

Running `book-producer install` installs:

- `.book-framework/README.md` — the runtime user guide installed into the repository
- the framework docs and agent files under `.book-framework/`
- editor and agent pointer files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `CLAUDE.md`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.cursor/rules/book-producer.mdc`
  - `.agents/workflows/book-producer.md`

It also installs the framework agents, including:

- numbered framework agents:
  - `1-book-init`
  - `2-book-planner`
  - `3-book-designer`
  - `4-chapter-writer`
  - `5-book-reviewer`
  - `6-publish-assembler`
- standalone specialist agents:
  - `concept-architect`
  - `book-outliner`
  - `book-blurb-writer`
  - `chapter-extender`
  - `line-editor`
  - `developmental-editor`
  - `character-world-designer`
  - `chapter-arc-architect`
  - `continuity-checker`
  - `research-fact-integrity`
  - `sensitivity-reader`
  - `book-project-manager`

Running `book-producer init "Book Title"` creates:

- `.spec/<book-slug>/state.json`
- `.spec/<book-slug>/00-current-status.md`
- `.spec/<book-slug>/01-init.md`
- `.spec/<book-slug>/assets/chapter-memory.json`
- `.spec/<book-slug>/assets/chapter-word-counts.json`
- `.spec/.branch-mapping.json`
- `<book-slug>/chapters/` at repo root (chapters type) or `<book-slug>/pages/` at repo root (pages type)

## Book workflow layout

After `book-producer install` and `book-producer init "My Book"`:

```text
.book-framework/
.spec/
  .branch-mapping.json
  my-book/
    state.json
    00-current-status.md
    01-init.md
    assets/
      chapter-memory.json
my-book/
  chapters/          # chapters type (default)
  # or pages/        # pages type (--type pages)
```

Important:

- `.book-framework/` is the installed framework package inside the user's repository.
- `.spec/<book-slug>/` is where the book specs and workflow memory live.
- `<book-slug>/` at repo root is the actual book output (chapters and final manuscript).

## Stage model

Six numbered stages drive the workflow:

| Stage | Agent | Stage file | What happens |
|-------|-------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | `1-book-init` | `01-init.md` | Capture concept, audience, genre, publishing intent, success criteria |
| 2 | `2-book-planner` | `02-plan.md` | Build execution plan: chapter list, milestones, dependencies, continuity map |
| 3 | `3-book-designer` | `03-design.md` | Final content design: plot summary, chapter summaries, continuity constraints, Mermaid diagrams |
| 4 | `4-chapter-writer` | `04-implementation.md` | Create chapter or page files under `<book-slug>/chapters/` (chapters type) or `<book-slug>/pages/` (pages type) |
| 5 | `5-book-reviewer` | `05-review.md` | Editorial, grammar, continuity, and full spec consistency review *(optional)* |
| 6 | `6-publish-assembler` | `06-finalization.md` | Assemble approved chapters into the final manuscript |

Stage 1 language tracker behavior:

- capture the book's `instructionLanguage` from the first initialization prompt by default
- if the user explicitly names another instruction/spec language in that prompt, use that explicit override instead
- capture the book's `mainLanguage` from the user's initialization intent
- capture `otherLanguages` for additional languages that may appear in parts of the book
- store all three values in `.spec/<book-slug>/state.json`
- allow updates at any time when the user changes language requirements
- if `instructionLanguage` changes explicitly, translate the existing `.spec/<book-slug>/` workflow files before continuing

Stage 4 runtime behavior for non-Claude tools:

- on entry (if not already set), the user is asked to choose chapter batching: `all`, `1`, or grouped sizes (`2+`)
- the same prompt warns that larger uninterrupted runs can exhaust model/API limits
- the choice is saved in `.spec/<book-slug>/state.json` as `chapterBatchSize` and can be changed later
- chapter writing still runs one-by-one in numeric order; chapter `N+1` starts only after chapter `N` is complete

Stage files are created lazily:

- Initialization creates `00-current-status.md`, `01-init.md`, and `state.json`.
- Later numbered stage files are created only when that stage starts after explicit user approval.
- Outside initialization, create at most two numbered stage files in one pass: a missing predecessor for recovery and the current stage file being started.

The workflow is used in chat after installation. The stages are as follows:

1. `1-book-init`: `AGENTS.md initialize this book idea`
2. `2-book-planner`: `plan this book`
3. `3-book-designer`: `design the chapters`
4. `4-chapter-writer`: `write the chapters`
5. `5-book-reviewer`: `review this book`
6. `6-publish-assembler`: `finalize this`

All of those steps are called in the AI chat and do not need to be referenced explicitly after initialization. Simple prompts such as `lets move to the next step`, `next step`, or `do the next step` should move the framework to the next numbered stage.

If a request sounds like it is asking for multiple stages at once, book-producer should explain that it only runs one stage at a time, suggest the next recommended numbered stage first, and ask the user to confirm one single stage to run now.

## What safety and destructive behavior exists

The framework is designed to install into the target repository and update its own managed framework files.

Important behavior to know:

- `book-producer install` writes or updates framework-related files in the repository

- `book-producer install --force` resets the installed framework files under `.book-framework/` back to the package defaults

- `book-producer init --force` is intended to reset the current book spec files under `.spec/<book-slug>/` for that book only; it does not delete chapter or page files under `<book-slug>/chapters/` (or `<book-slug>/pages/` for pages-type books)

- the install command may update pointer files such as `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so supported tools are redirected to the installed framework

- `6-publish-assembler` requires explicit user confirmation before any cleanup step; cleanup is irreversible

As with any repository-writing tool, review changes before committing them, especially when using `--force`.

## One simple example flow

A typical workflow looks like this:

1. Install the package globally:

```bash
npm install -g book-producer
```

2. Install the framework inside your repository:

```bash
book-producer install
```

3. Create a new book idea:

```bash
book-producer init "The Last Signal"
```

4. In a new chat in your supported AI tool, initialize the book:

```text
AGENTS.md initialize this book idea. Only do the initialization step.
```

5. Continue through the numbered workflow stages in chat:

```text
plan this book
design the chapters
write the chapters
review this book
finalize this
```

6. At any point, ask for status:

```text
what's my status
```

## Tool compatibility

The framework is designed to work with:

- Claude
- GitHub Copilot
- Cursor
- Antigravity

Tool behavior is intentionally different:

- Chapter generation is sequential for all tools, including Claude.
- Claude may still use orchestration helpers for research packets.
- Copilot, Cursor, Antigravity, and other tools must stay sequential.
- In sequential tools, Stage 4 asks for (or reuses) a non-Claude chapter batch preference and writes chapters one-by-one even when batching is `all` or grouped.

Orchestration mode is auto-detected at `book-producer init` time: parallel if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `CLAUDE_*` env vars, or a `.claude/` directory is present; sequential otherwise. It can be overridden with `--mode parallel|sequential`.

## CLI commands

```bash
book-producer install
book-producer init "My Book"
book-producer init "My Book" --type pages --category fiction --text-length small
book-producer init "My Book" --images --image-strategy auto --image-placement per-page --image-continuity prompt-injection
book-producer init "My Book" --category non-fiction --research-strategy active-web
book-producer init "My Book" --language "English" --other-languages "Spanish,French" --instruction-language "Spanish"
book-producer status [slug]

book-producer orchestrate extend [slug] --tool <tool> --under-target
book-producer orchestrate research [slug] --tool <tool> --topics "topic one,topic two"
```
