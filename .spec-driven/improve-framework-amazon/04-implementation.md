# 04-implementation

## What changed
Built the `book-framework` npm package from scratch: CLI binary, command modules, lib utilities, framework asset docs, agent markdown files, stage templates, and tests. Then refactored the workflow semantics so stage 3 is the final book design handoff, stage 4 materializes `book/chapters/` with one file per designed chapter, stage 5 is the quality/editorial review pass, and stage 6 concatenates chapter files without rewriting them. Original LibriScribe Python source files were deleted after all content was extracted into framework agent docs.

## Why it changed
Per `03-design.md`: replace the Python LibriScribe runtime with a Claude-first, multi-agent book creation framework distributed as an npm package, installable in any repository. The later refactor aligned the workflow to the real content pipeline: initialize idea → plan work → design final book contents → implement the book → editorial/quality review → final assembly.

## Cleanup log
Deleted after all agent content extracted and rewritten into `book-framework/assets/agents/`:
- `src/libriscribe/` — Python agents, utilities, settings adapted into markdown agent docs
- `prompts/templates/` — YAML prompt templates rewritten as agent instruction sections
- Root Python packaging files and Docusaurus docs site no longer applicable

## Files touched
See Implementation log above.

## Validation and tests executed
- `npm install` at repo root — dependencies installed successfully after flattening the package to the repository root
- `npm run build` — first run failed on strict optional typing in 3 command files; fixed by conditionally spreading `autoYes` only when defined; second run passed
- `npm test` — full test suite via vitest passed (`9` files, `86` tests)
- Post-refactor rebuild/test after workflow changes (`book/chapters` layout, stage 3/4/5/6 contract changes, no-rewrite finalizer) — passed

## Lint / static-analysis
- TypeScript strict mode enabled in `tsconfig.json`
- ESLint configured at repo root; `npm run lint` passes after flat-config migration and typed test-project coverage fix

## Remaining gaps / follow-ups
- Amazon metadata artifacts (`book-blurb-writer` output integration into `06-finalization`) deferred to v2
- Public package name/scope issue resolved: package renamed to `book-producer` before first publish
- Compatibility aliases with `united-we-stand` commands not implemented (open question from init)
- `sensitivity-reader` agent instruction is a first-pass draft; professional editorial review recommended before use in production

## Amendment - multi-tool release and orchestration refresh

### What changed
- Added dual release preparation for npm (`book-producer`) and GitHub Packages (`@<owner>/book-producer`)
- Replaced the stale docs deploy workflow with package CI and publish workflows
- Installed managed tool entrypoint sections/files for Claude, Copilot, Cursor, and Antigravity that point back to `.book-framework/`
- Added `book-producer orchestrate chapters` and `book-producer orchestrate research` commands to emit tool-specific work packets
- Installed `.book-framework/CHAT-WORKFLOW.md` and `.book-framework/tooling/`
- Hardened branch detection for unborn branches by preferring `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`
- Updated docs to explain that `.book-framework/` is installed in user repos, `.spec/<slug>/` stores specs, and later stage files are created lazily

### Validation rerun
- `npm run build`
- `npm test` (`12` files, `101` tests)
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run prepare:publish:npm`
- `BOOK_PRODUCER_GITHUB_SCOPE=@mrudinal npm run prepare:publish:github`
- `npm pack ./.release/npm`
- `npm pack ./.release/github`
- Fresh target repo smoke test: `install`, `init`, `orchestrate`, and `doctor` all passed

## Amendment - gitignore cleanup

### What changed
- Reorganized the root `.gitignore` into grouped sections for dependencies, build outputs, environment files, temp/log files, and editor/OS noise
- Added common temp/runtime artifacts such as `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `tmp/`, `temp/`, npm/yarn/pnpm debug logs, and `.tmp-review-summary.txt`
- Added npm cache entries plus `package-lock.json` to the ignore list per the requested housekeeping pass

### Notes
- `package-lock.json` is already a tracked file in this repository, so adding it to `.gitignore` affects new/untracked cases only and does not automatically remove the existing tracked file from git history or index

## Amendment - stage 4 non-Claude batching controls (0.1.1)

### What changed
- Added persistent non-Claude chapter batching preference (`chapterBatchSize`) to state typing, initial state creation, and state template output
- Updated chapter orchestration command to:
	- prompt for batch mode when missing (`all`, `1`, grouped `2+`)
	- warn about model/API limit exhaustion risk for large uninterrupted batches
	- persist and reuse batch preference, while allowing changes through `--batch-size`
- Updated chapter plan generation so non-Claude flows always write chapters one-by-one in numeric order:
	- `all` -> one uninterrupted packet that still processes chapters one-by-one
	- `1` -> one packet per chapter with explicit packet dependencies
	- grouped (`2+`) -> sequential packet groups with explicit dependencies
- Exposed stored non-Claude batch preference in `status` terminal output and JSON payload
- Updated framework docs, runtime docs, tooling adapters, API docs, and FAQ to match the new behavior
- Bumped release version from `0.1.0` to `0.1.1` and documented changes in `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSIONS.md`

### Validation rerun
- `npm run build` ✅
- `npm test` ✅ (`12` files, `103` tests)
- `npm run lint` ✅

## Amendment - multilingual language tracker (0.1.1)

### What changed
- Added persistent language tracking fields to runtime state: `mainLanguage` and `otherLanguages`
- Added language options to `init` command (`--language`, `--other-languages`) and state update behavior when resuming existing specs
- Added language tracker output to `status` JSON and terminal views
- Updated stage-1 agent and `01-init` template to capture main and additional languages at initialization
- Updated package/runtime docs (`README`, installed README, chat workflow, API, FAQ) to document multilingual support and user-driven language changes at any time
- Amended `0.1.1` release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSIONS.md` with language-tracking changes

### Validation rerun
- `npm run build` ✅
- `npm test` ✅ (`12` files, `104` tests)
- `npm run lint` ✅
- `npm run prepare:publish:npm` ✅
- `npm pack ./.release/npm` ✅

## Amendment - continuity-first chapter workflow hardening (0.1.1)

### What changed
- Enforced chapter orchestration sequencing for all tools in `buildChapterPlan` (including Claude): one-by-one chapter packets with explicit dependencies
- Updated Claude chapter orchestration messaging to indicate strict sequential chapter generation
- Updated stage-agent contracts:
	- stage 2 planner now requires continuity map from chapter 2 -> final
	- stage 3 designer now requires continuity-safe design checks against prior chapters
	- stage 4 writer now enforces sequential progression for all tools, including Claude
	- stage 5 reviewer now validates full spec consistency across init/plan/design/chapters
- Updated orchestration policy, tooling adapters, and chat/runtime docs to remove parallel chapter drafting assumptions
- Updated release notes and version tracker to capture the new chapter sequencing + continuity requirements

### Validation rerun
- `npm run build` ✅
- `npm test` ✅ (`12` files, `104` tests)
- `npm run lint` ✅
