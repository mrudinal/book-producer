# Current Status

- Current branch: improve-framework-amazon
- Current stage: 6-finalizer
- Completed steps: 1-initializer, 2-planner, 3-designer, 4-implementer, 5-code-reviewer
- Incompleted stages: 6-finalizer
- Next recommended step: 6-finalizer
- Status note: Added chapter continuity hardening across stages 2/3/4/5 plus orchestration enforcement that chapter generation is sequential and in-order for all tools (including Claude), while retaining Claude research orchestration support. Updated agent/policy/runtime/package docs and amended `0.1.1` notes accordingly. The workflow remains anchored at finalizer and is waiting for explicit user sign-off on the refreshed package/release state.
- Blockers / warnings: Public remote npm/GitHub publication was not executed from this branch, so the new publish workflows and scoped GitHub Packages variant were validated locally but not against a live remote release. Local build, lint, tests, package prep, pack, and fresh consumer-repo smoke tests passed. `package-lock.json` is now listed in `.gitignore`, but because it is already tracked, that rule does not remove it from version control by itself.
